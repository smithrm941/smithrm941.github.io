      Photography is an interest of mine that did not take me as long to realize
      as computer science. Since I was a pre-teen I have been badgering friends
      and family to let me take photos of them. My interest later evolved
      to include visiting as many photography exhibits as humanly possible, collecting
      photobooks and vintage cameras and currently includes being an active participant
      in my favorite genre of street photography and member of female art collective,
      OGM and public candid photography club, SFCPC, in addition to working in customer
      service at Photoworks, a photo lab in San Francisco.
