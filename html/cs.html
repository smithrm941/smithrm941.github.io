    <p>My route to computer science is the epitome of non-traditional.
        I went from being a history major to a market research job to a
        master's in public policy. More aware of a consistent interest
        in technology, I followed this with time in a coding bootcamp
        followed by an apprenticeship throught the Microsoft LEAP program.
        In order to build a better foundation before pursuing this field
        further, I am currently enrolled in Oregon State University's
        Computer Science Post-bacc program.
